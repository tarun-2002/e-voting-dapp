# Blockchain-Based Electronic Voting Dapp

## Introduction
This project is a Distributed Application (Dapp) built on the Ethereum blockchain for conducting electronic voting. The goal of this Dapp is to ensure the transparency, security, and integrity of the electoral process, thereby restoring trust in the voting system.

## Features
- **Permissioned Blockchain**: Only organisers can generate voters and candidates, ensuring the integrity of the voting process.
- **Transparent Voting**: Total votes for each candidate are visible to all participants, promoting transparency.
- **Secure Blockchain Network**: Utilises a secure and immutable blockchain network for recording and storing votes.
- **Real-Time Voting Progress**: An intuitive user interface tracks voting progress in real time, providing visibility into the voting process.
- **Automatic Result Tabulation**: The system automatically tabulates results when all votes are cast, ensuring fair and uncompromised election results.


## Future Plans
- **Geographic Simulation**: Introduce a system that simulates actual countries, states, and constituencies to replicate the dynamics of real elections.
- **Multi-Party Elections**: Allow parties to contest elections from various constituencies, enabling a diverse selection of candidates from different parties.
- **Seat-Based Victory Criteria**: Determine the winner based on the number of seats gained by each political party in all constituencies, simulating actual political situations.
- **Realistic and Immersive Experience**: Add features to make the project more realistic and immersive, allowing users to vote as they would in real life.

## Tech Stack
- **React Js**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract language for implementing the voting logic on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **IPFS**: InterPlanetary File System for decentralized storage of static assets and metadata.
- **Pinata Web Services**: IPFS pinning service for ensuring availability and persistence of data.
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
- **Ethereum**: Blockchain platform used for executing smart contracts and recording votes.
